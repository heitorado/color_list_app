# Color List
Its an react-native toy app that shows a list of seven colors. When you start the app, they're all white. When you click on one of them, a random color hex is generated and the background color for that list item changes to that color. 

...and that's pretty much it.

It was fun to code it to practice the very basics of react-native.


## Credits
App launcher Icon made by [Smashicons](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/smashicons) from [www.flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/).


This app is never going to be released for obvious reasons, but since it wasn't me who made the icon (I just put it on a white background using the awesome tool [Android Asset Studio](http://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/) ) I felt obligated on giving credit to the original author. Also congrats 'smashicons', it's a really nice icon.

## Wrapping up
That's all. Peace.
