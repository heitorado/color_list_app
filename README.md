# Color List
Its an react-native toy app that shows a list of seven colors. When you start the app, they're all white. When you click on one of them, a random color hex is generated and the background color for that list item changes to that color. 

...and that's pretty much it.

It was fun to code it to practice the very basics of react-native.
